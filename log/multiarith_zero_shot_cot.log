Q: There were 10 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: First, we know that there were originally 10 friends playing the game. Then, 7 players quit, leaving 3 players remaining. Since each player had 8 lives, we can multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of lives remaining. 3 x 8 = 24. Therefore, the remaining players had a total of 24 lives. The answer is  24 lives.

Q: There were 10 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many players are left after 7 players quit and then calculate the total number of lives they have.1. Start with the total number of players: 10 friends.2. Subtract the number of players who quit: 10 - 7 = 3 players remaining.3. Each remaining player has 8 lives.4. Calculate the total number of lives for the remaining players: 3 players × 8 lives per player = 24 lives.Therefore, the total number of lives the remaining players have is 24. The answer is 24 lives.
